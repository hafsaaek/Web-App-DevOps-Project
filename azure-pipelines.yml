# Starter pipeline
# Start with a minimal pipeline that you can customize to build and deploy your code.
# Add steps that build, run tests, deploy, and more:
# https://aka.ms/yaml

trigger:
- main

pool:
  vmImage: ubuntu-latest # specifies the virtual machine or container environment where the pipeline's tasks will run. In this case, it's set to use an Ubuntu-based image (vmImage: ubuntu-latest). The choice of the image depends on the requirements of your project, and you can select different images based on your needs.Ω
